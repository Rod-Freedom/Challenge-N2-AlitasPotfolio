# **Challenge-N2-AlitasPotfolio**
A work portfolio for Alita

## **ABOUT THE PROJECT**

Since I still don't have many abilities to display in a portfolio of myself, I decided to create a fictitious portfolio for one of my favorite anime characters: Alita, the Battle Angel.
Alita is supposedly looking for a freelance job, and this is the way to do it.

</br>

I wanted to test everything I've learned so far in CSS and HTML and I've learned a great deal extra because of the challenge; so the code includes all the CSS and HTML functions and technics I could muster:

* Media Queries (responsive and changing design for different devices)
* Variables (CSS)
* Favicon
* Custom Fonts (linked from a generated stylesheet in Google Fonts)
* Grid (changes template in media queries, there are grids within grids)
* Flex (interacts with grid display)
* Responsive Units (vh, vw, rem...)
* Hover Effects
    * text underlining (background technic with linear-gradient)
    * image opacity filter (made with position absolute and background color opacity)
* Links (images and text)
* Position (relative and absolute)
* Margins, Padding and Borders
* Border Radius
* Responsive Images (made with cover background-size linked directly in the CSS)

## **USAGE**

The site will respond to your device size. All the clickable elements in the site (links) have an interactive animation (on hover), so you'll know when something is clickable. Scroll along and have fun! [Go to site!](https://rod-freedom.github.io/Challenge-N2-AlitasPotfolio/)
